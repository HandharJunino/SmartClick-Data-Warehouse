   cd SmartClick-Data-Warehouse
   ```

2. **Create the database**
   ```sql

## üíª Usage

### Basic Operations

```sql
-- Connect to the database
\c smartclick_data_warehouse

-- View all tables
\dt

-- Check data in a specific table
SELECT * FROM consumer LIMIT 10;
```

### Data Analysis Examples

```sql
-- Top performing consumers by total checkout value
SELECT * FROM consumer_interaction_summary;

-- Marketing ROI by campaign
SELECT 
    campaign_name,
    SUM(return_on_investment) as total_roi
FROM marketing_performance mp
JOIN campaign c ON mp.campaign_id = c.campaign_id

ORDER BY total_roi DESC;
```

## üîç Sample Queries

The database includes several pre-built analytical queries:

### 1. Top Performing Campaigns

-- Top 20 campaigns by ROI with rollup analysis
SELECT 
    ca.campaign_name,
    SUM(mp.return_on_investment) AS total_roi
FROM 
    marketing_performance mp
JOIN 
    campaign ca ON mp.campaign_id = ca.campaign_id
GROUP BY 
    ROLLUP(ca.campaign_name)
ORDER BY 
    total_roi DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### 2. Consumer Interaction Summary
```sql
-- Comprehensive consumer behavior analysis
CREATE VIEW consumer_interaction_summary AS
SELECT 
    ci.consumer_id,
    c.name AS consumer_name,
    COUNT(*) AS total_interactions,
    SUM(ci.total_items_viewed) AS total_items_viewed,
    SUM(ci.total_items_purchased) AS total_items_purchased,
    SUM(ci.basket_subtotal) AS total_basket_subtotal,
    SUM(ci.total_checkout_price) AS total_checkout_price
FROM 
    CONSUMER_INTERACTION ci
JOIN 
    CONSUMER c ON ci.consumer_id = c.consumer_id
GROUP BY 
    ci.consumer_id, c.name 
ORDER BY 
    total_checkout_price DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### 3. Channel Performance Analysis
